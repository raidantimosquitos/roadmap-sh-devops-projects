## Requirements
You can these three scripts on any Ubuntu/Debian system, which contains the `apt` packet manager. The user must have `sudo` permissions to run all three scripts. It also assumes that your system contains the default `/var/log` directory. If you do not have sudo rights, you can refer to this [link](https://linuxhandbook.com/check-if-user-has-sudo-rights/) to add your user as a sudo user.
