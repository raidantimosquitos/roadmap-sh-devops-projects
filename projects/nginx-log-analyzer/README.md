## Requirements
You can run this script on any Linux/Unix device. It assumes that you have the `nginx-access.log` file in the same directory you will run the script.

In my case I am running on a `Ubuntu 20.04` system.

## Usage
First clone the repository into a directory of your choice.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/raidantimosquitos/nginx-log-analyzer.git
```

To run this project, use the following command:
```bash
bash nginx-log-analyzer
```
