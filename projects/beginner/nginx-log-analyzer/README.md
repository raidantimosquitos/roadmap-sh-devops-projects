## Requirements
You can run this script on any Linux/Unix device. It assumes that you have the `nginx-access.log` file in the same directory you will run the script.

In my case I am running on a `Ubuntu 20.04` system.

## Usage
To run this project, use the following command:
```bash
bash nginx-log-analyzer
```
